          Inspired and motivated by the capabilities of a human to evolve and do things beyond imagination, AjnaLens was
          born. Ajna represents the sixth primary chakra, or the third eye, whereas Lens stands for next-generation
          wearable technology. The two, when put together, can transform human lives, empowering and enabling them to
          unleash their potential and reach the highest version of themselves. And that is what forms the base of
          everything that we have done or will do. AjnaLens' AR glasses were born as a catalyst to outperform in work
          and personal lives. What initially started as a revolutionary tool for the defence sector proved invaluable
          and expanded into enterprise and training sectors. The make-in-India, for-the-world vision emanated in our
          experts' minds, creating newer avenues of innovation and growth in the tech space. Pushing our own limits and
          setting standards, we built the industryâ€™s first metaverse training platform, redefining the entire learning
          ecosystem. AjnaLens seeks to lead by example, making immersive learning the new form of skill training. Our
          technology has proven especially beneficial across all sectors (enterprise, defence, educational, etc.), and
          we constantly strive to push the boundaries through our advanced hardware and customised software solutions.
          The future is now, and AjnaLens creates a new technological frontier, transforming societies for the better.
